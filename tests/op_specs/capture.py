"""Turn a PyTorch program into standalone, runnable OpSpec scripts.

Point it at a script you already have -- it runs unmodified -- and it writes one
self-contained Python file per compiled kernel::

    python tests/op_specs/capture.py my_repro.py --out captured/
    python captured/sdsc_fused_add_mul_0.py

Each emitted file carries that kernel's whole OpSpec list plus tensors matching
the real shapes, dtypes and device layouts, so it reproduces the backend half of
the compile with the Inductor frontend removed.

A *kernel* here is one ``SpyreAsyncCompile.sdsc()`` call, which generally holds
several OpSpecs -- so one emitted file is one kernel, not one operation.  The
target script need not call ``torch.compile``: many eager Spyre ops are
themselves implemented by compiling, which is also why a script running an op
both ways compiles it twice (see :func:`dedup_key`).

Options:
    --out DIR         where to write the scripts (default: ./captured)
    --kernel NAME     only emit kernels whose name contains NAME
    --save-inputs     also dump recorded input values to a .pt beside each
                      script, for byte-exact replay
    --no-execute      capture without a device or backend compiler (see below)
    --no-explain-header
                      omit the decoded OpSpec explanation from each script

Exit status:
    0                 the target ran to completion and every kernel was written
    3                 scripts were written, but the target raised partway through
                      so later kernels are missing (see ``EXIT_PARTIAL``)
    1                 nothing was written
