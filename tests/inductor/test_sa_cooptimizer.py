"""Validation for the end-to-end SA co-optimization engine.

The two gates the engine must pass:

* **determinism** -- two runs on identical input give bit-for-bit identical
  ``chosen_division`` + ``address``; and
* **>= baseline on the shared scorer** -- the returned state never scores worse
  than the seed (index-0 divisions + FirstFit ``pi``), the seed-from-baseline +
  keep-best guarantee.

Plus the engine's output contract: every buffer gets a ``chosen_division`` and an
``address`` (``None`` == spilled), with ``spill_reasons`` populated for the
misses. Runs over the real-shaped captured graphs at several capacities, so
residency pressure (spills / eligibility toggles) is actually exercised.
