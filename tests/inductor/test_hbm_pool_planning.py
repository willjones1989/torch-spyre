        """A buffer that is only ever read *inside* a CountedLoopScheduler
        Node's own body (a loop-carried accumulator, e.g. a running-max/sum
        pattern where each iteration reads the value the previous iteration
        wrote) must be treated as live for the whole loop -- not as ending
        right where that internal read/write happens to sit in a fully
        flattened node list.

        CountedLoopSchedulerNode represents a loop that runs loop_count
        times at runtime as a *single* node in its containing bundle's own
        node list (see CountedLoopSchedulerNode.unpack(), which refuses to
        unpack itself). The IR only contains one copy of the loop body, so
        there is no second, later textual read for a "did this survive
        another iteration" check to find -- liveness across iterations has
        to be inferred from the fact that this is a loop, i.e. by treating
        it as one opaque step whose live buffers are live for that entire
        step, not by fully flattening its body into separate timesteps.

        Setup: "init" writes "acc" outside the loop. The loop's body reads
        and writes "acc" (the accumulate step) and separately writes
        "other" (e.g. a per-iteration scratch tile, freshly written on
        every pass). After the loop, "final" reads only "other" -- "acc"
        is never read again outside the loop.

        With the buggy fully-flattened live-range computation, "acc"'s
        only visible read is inside the loop body itself, so its computed
        live range collapses to a single point (start == end) that ends
        before "other"'s start -- the allocator frees "acc"'s block and
        hands the identical byte offset to "other", even though the loop's
        accumulator and the loop's own scratch tile are simultaneously
        live at runtime throughout the loop's execution. With the fix
        (bundle.get_nodes() -- one entry for the whole loop, not one per
        body-op -- passed to _compute_live_ranges), the loop node's merged
        read/write set (ReadWrites.merge_list) drops "acc" entirely, since
        it is both written and read within the same node; with no visible
        read, _compute_live_ranges conservatively keeps "acc" live through
        the rest of the bundle, which safely overlaps "other" and gives the
        two buffers distinct offsets.

        _make_fused returns it directly as the top-level bundle (see
        _make_fused in fusion.py: `len(nodes) == 1` returns `nodes[0]`
        unwrapped, not a FusedSchedulerNode of one). In that case `bundle`
