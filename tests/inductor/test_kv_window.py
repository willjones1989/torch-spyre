"""The window placement, the algorithm it implies, and the op that reads it.

Three levels, in the order a failure is worth reading:

  1. PLACEMENT -- pure integer arithmetic, no device. Where each Q block reads
     from and how wide its buffer is. Everything else rests on one invariant:
     every query row's window lies inside the buffer its block reads.

  2. ALGORITHM -- on CPU: does attending against the compact buffer compute
     the same thing as masking the full cache? Two claims, kept apart because
     they say different things. The set of unmasked columns is *identical*
     (combinatorial, no tolerance) -- that is what licenses the approach. The
     output values agree -- that only says the arithmetic was not fumbled.

  3. THE OP -- spyre::kv_window on device, against slices built
     independently here.

Bit-exactness is not available at level 2 and must not be asserted: the
windowed softmax reduces buffer_width terms where the reference reduces
seqlen_kv, and sum blocks its reduction differently at different widths.
