"""The relayout decision, driven without a graph.

A relayout group's destination is a ``RelayoutCopyBuffer``: an ordinary buffer
whose residency IS the decision to shuffle, placed by the same no-overlap as
everything else and priced by a plain term of the shared sympy objective
(``cost_term``, one ``RelayoutCharge`` node per copy). Handcrafted buffers
drive the pieces directly - no graph, no compile:

- the price term is solver-agnostic: evaluated by ``lambdify`` it charges the
  source's chosen division exactly when the copy is resident;
- under ``CpSatLayoutSolver`` a relayout fires when its fitted cost beats the
  spill it avoids, and only then; the copy occupies real LX (capacity can
  veto); no relayout is decided under the fallback objective; the gate's old
  behavior (no match, no table -> spilled) survives;
- one copy serves every consumer of a group (one charge), distinct views are
  distinct copies, the charge follows the chosen source division, and a copy
  that cannot be held across its consumers spills the source rather than
  re-shuffling;
- the commit path regroups fired edges by (source, destination view).

The producer P (uses [0, 1]) feeds consumer C (uses [1, 2]). P and C each
carry one 4-way division; ``cd_parent_matches`` is EMPTY on the edge, so
residency for P is possible only through the relayout copy.
