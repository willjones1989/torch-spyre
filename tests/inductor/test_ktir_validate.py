"""Dialect-free tests for the OpSpec->KTIR emitter's *rejections*.

**Nothing in this file imports ``mlir_ktdp``, directly or transitively, and
nothing in it is skipped.**  That is the property ``ktir.build_kernel_plan``
exists to provide: every ``NotImplementedError`` the emitter can raise is raised
by a pure walk over the spec tree, before the lazy dialect import, so the whole rejection
surface is covered wherever ``import torch_spyre`` works.

``test_ktir_emitter.py`` holds the complement -- the golden MLIR snapshots, which
do need the dialect build and are skipped without it.  It imports the shared spec
builders from here (``make_op_spec`` and friends), so they stay dialect-free.

# One builder, so a test states only what it is about and states it on one line:
# ``make_op_spec()`` is the whole pointwise contract the frontend produces, and
# every keyword is one deviation from it.  The ``TensorArg``s are built inside,
# because their two positional fields are not a test's to choose: ``arg_index``
# is the position among the HBM args, and an arg that memory planning placed (an
# ``lx`` / ``hbm_pool`` allocation) is not passed in at all, so it takes -1 and
# consumes no position -- the frontend's own rule, applied here rather than
# restated per fixture.
#
# The per-arg keywords (``names`` / ``sizes`` / ``allocations`` / ``advances``)
# are indexed over inputs then outputs, and may be short or hold ``None`` to
# leave an arg at its default.

    HBM inputs and one HBM output at identity ``(d0, ..., dn)`` coordinates, with
    the HBM address left unassigned (the symbolic form reads no address, and the
    baked form is the one that rejects that).

    The deviations, each a keyword:

    * ``op`` / ``inputs`` / ``outputs`` / ``names`` -- the op and its roles.
    * ``size`` for every arg, or ``sizes`` per arg; likewise ``coords`` for every
      arg or ``coords_per_arg`` for one list each, which a reduction needs because
      its output drops an axis.  ``coords=[]`` is a tiled arg, addressing through
      ``advances`` instead of coordinates.
    * ``arrangements`` per arg, for a buffer whose elements are not in the
      standard order -- ``ElementArrangement.EXX2`` is a statistic buffer holding
      two values in one element, and the default is ``STANDARD``.
    * ``allocations`` per arg, for an ``lx`` / ``hbm_pool`` intermediate or an
      unrecognised space; ``baked=True`` for the byte HBM address the baked form
      wants, which is the same field said the other way, so not both.
    * ``kernel_locals`` per arg: the bit the scheduler fills, saying nothing
      outside this kernel reads the buffer.  Defaults to False, as it does in
      the contract.
    * ``divisions`` maps a coordinate symbol's name to its work division;
      ``space`` replaces the iteration space outright (``{}`` for a tiled op).
    * ``tiled`` / ``trips`` are the loop-level symbols and trip counts, and
      ``first_arg_index`` continues the numbering for a second op in one kernel.
    * ``op_info`` is the op's auxiliary dict, which the recipes that take scalar
      arguments read (softplus's beta/threshold live in ``op_info["constants"]``);
      it defaults to empty, which every other op wants.
