"""Hand-built co-optimization graphs targeting structural coverage gaps.

The captured corpus (``cooptimization_captures.json``) is small -- four building
blocks, ``n`` <= 25, only ``sdpa`` with real pins or multi-op region structure
-- too thin for anything whose value only shows up on multiple regions or a
non-trivial ``n``. Real captures need the substrate and carry a ``solved``
reference validated by ``test_cooptimization_types.py``; these synthetic fixtures
deliberately do *not* -- they have no ground-truth engine output, so they
exercise only the **shape-invariant** SA guarantees (output contract,
>= baseline, determinism, region flood, recolor-finds-regions), never the
empirical schedule-quality assertions calibrated on the real corpus.

Each graph is a plain list of ``CoreDivisionBuffer`` built to isolate one
structure the captures under-cover:

* ``chain_long`` / ``chain_short`` -- one uniform region of very different
  op-count but similar coloring variety: the anchor-fairness case. Anchors are
  picked uniformly over ops, so a region draws recolor proposals in proportion to
  its op-count, which under-serves a small region carrying comparable coloring
  variety.
* ``wide_join`` -- a fan-in diamond whose sink cannot satisfy every parent's
  tiling at once: many accepted internal seams + ``num_children`` spill scaling.
* ``multi_region`` -- three uniform regions separated by boundary edges that
  carry only the trivial pair, so the flood stops for free at each boundary
  (boundaries emerge from the flood rather than being detected) and recolor has
  several regions to pick.
* ``k_split_consumers`` -- a clean producer read by reduction-split (K-split)
  consumers via the PSUM ring, plus a reduction-split *producer* that is gated
  out of LX because no child edge carries its partial-write index -- the
  compatibility gate, not the fixed pin.
* ``pinned_heavy`` -- resident buffers interleaved with several pinned buffers
  spanning distinct ``residency_reason`` values, so the fixed pin gate is
  exercised while pins still gate neighbors and contribute always-HBM traffic.
* ``big_chain`` -- a ~50-buffer multi-region graph for compile-time-budget /
  burst-scaling exercise and a heavier determinism load.
