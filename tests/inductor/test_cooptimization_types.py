"""The SA co-optimizer against the *real* substrate types.

During development of the SA co-optimizer, the buffer types were in flux. The
branch was developed on top of an artificial substrate isolated from this
churn. There was a test suite asserting that this substrate conformed to the
protocols that defined it. When ``CoreDivisionBuffer`` landed, the test suite
turned into this file, which pins the engine to the real classes:

* the captured graphs rehydrate into real :class:`CoreDivisionBuffer` objects
  that are well-formed, self-consistent, and a valid seed state (every op at
  division index 0);
* the engine really is a :class:`CoreDivisionLayoutSolver` and accepts those
  objects;
* the two capture-derived assumptions the loader and the objective rest on hold:
  the ``boundary_cost`` -> ``BufferType`` mapping is exact, and ``read_count``
  equals the consumer count the old objective scaled by.
