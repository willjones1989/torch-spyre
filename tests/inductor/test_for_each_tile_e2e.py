"""End-to-end Spyre-device tests for WhileLoop -> OpSpec/LoopSpec lowering.

Compiles each fixture, runs it on the Spyre device, and compares against a
CPU reference -- for IR-level / mocked-IR unit tests of the lowering
machinery itself, see test_for_each_tile_lowering.py.

Minimum coverage per docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-09-while-loop-lowering-design.md:
1. Single carry (this file: test_carry_mode_split_k) -- currently XFAIL on a
   read-copy/stick-layout gap; see that test's own docstring.
2 (carry + Kind.SLICE tile-advancing input): covered implicitly by
   test_carry_mode_split_k, whose X/Y operands are both Kind.SLICE.
3. Kind.GATHER: covered by test_gather_mode_paged_pages, which gathers one
   page per trip from inside the body the way paged attention does.
4. Multiple independent carries: covered by test_carry_mode_online_softmax
   (carry = (m, denom, acc), an online-softmax flash-attention inner loop).
Case 5 (nested for_each_tile) covers pure map/map nesting in
TestForEachTileNestedMapE2E, map/carry nesting in
test_batched_map_over_online_softmax_carry, and carry/carry nesting (depth=2
and depth=3) in TestForEachTileNestedCarryE2E. The map/carry case stages
full K/V buffers in the outer batch map, then slices those staged buffers in
the inner Lk carry, exercising per-level ownership of input advances. Case 6
(deliberate-decline) is still open, tracked as a follow-on item.

test_map_mode_split_m (map mode: Kind.SLICE + Kind.INVARIANT operands, a
stacking carry, no user carry) passes end to end with verified numerics and
is the case that exercises the full splice -> DimHint synthesis ->
coarse-tile -> single scf.for pipeline.

TestForEachTilePointwiseE2E adds simpler single-level pointwise/softmax
coverage (add, abs, a 3-operand abs(a+b)*c chain, row-tiled softmax),
ported down from test_coarse_tile_e2e.py's HINT-driven test_add_*/test_abs_*
and test_hint_softmax_row_tiling families -- for_each_tile doesn't need
coarse_tile's exhaustive combinatorial coverage, but benefits from its own
easy-to-debug cases, including a multi-stick tile_size variant of each
(multi-stick tiling has been a historical source of bugs; see
test_hint_softmax_row_tiling's docstring on the device_size[1] invariant).

    a reset, a later test's compile of the SAME function object can hit
    Dynamo's guard/recompile cache from an earlier test and skip re-entering

    DeviceTypeTestBase's own setUp() -- which never calls super().setUp() --
    wins the MRO over this class's setUp(), silently skipping the reset.

        Root cause: the innermost tile add's output is reshaped by
        ``for_each_tile`` lowering into ``[2, 4, 2]`` (splitting the row's
        flat 8-wide column axis into 4 tiles of width 2, matching

        ``propagate_layouts.py`` builds that buffer's device layout purely
        from its own reshaped shape, picking the size-2 last dim as the
        stick dim. But the consuming op one level up reads the same buffer
        back with the *flattened* ``8*d0 + d1`` index (ranges ``d0:2,
        d1:8``), expecting one whole 8-wide stick-compatible axis. No
        per-shape STL of ``[2, 4, 2]`` can satisfy that: the inner tile
        (2 elements) is far below ``elems_per_stick`` (64), so stick padding
        breaks the 4x replication needed to reconstruct the flat axis,
        producing the unrepresentable ``Mod(d1, 2)`` coordinate. This is a
        genuine sub-stick tiling gap in ``_clone_layout``'s output-STL
        construction, not specific to add or to this test's shape -- fixing
        it needs ``_clone_layout`` to offer (or inherit) a layout that keeps
        the flattened axis whole, deferred as a separate task.

    were whole-stick, repeating the first tile's gather on every subsequent
    trip. #4829's own regression coverage of that guard
    (``TestIndirectIndexStepGuard`` in test_for_each_tile_lowering.py) only
    exercises it via a synthetic CPU ``sympy`` expression; no test compiles
    an actual sub-stick advance on device. This test closes that gap: it
    asserts that compiling ``substick_gather_fn`` raises the documented
    ``UnalignedStickSplit`` failure (surfaced through the wrapping
    ``InductorError``) instead of returning a plausible-looking wrong
    answer. See issue #4835 and the parent issue #4828.
