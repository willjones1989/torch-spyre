    """Where each Q block reads, in absolute cache coordinates: row ``i`` sits
    at ``q_kv_offset + i``, which is what lets prefill and decode share one
    formula.

    Two lengths, deliberately separate. ``seqlen_kv`` is the cache's logical
    position (HF's ``cumulative_length``, vLLM's ``seq_lens``) -- what a
    coordinate *means*, so ``row_window`` clamps against it.
    ``cache_capacity`` is ``key.size(2)``, the rows physically allocated --
    what a *read* may not run past, so ``read_start`` clamps against it.
    Either may be larger:

    - ``seqlen_kv <= cache_capacity`` -- still filling. ``buffer_origin`` 0,
      left-aligned; ``[seqlen_kv, cache_capacity)`` is allocated but
      unwritten. A read routinely lands past ``seqlen_kv`` (which need not be
      stick-aligned) and that is safe: every query row's own coordinate is
      ``< seqlen_kv``, so causal masking's ``column <= row`` already excludes
      those columns. They must still hold *finite* values -- an additive
      ``-inf`` cannot rescue a ``NaN``.
    - ``seqlen_kv > cache_capacity`` -- a compact buffer that has filled and
      is sliding forward, ``buffer_origin > 0``. Rows must stay contiguous,
      time-ordered and oldest-first; unchecked here, see ``kv_window``.
    - Equal -- the full-length, exactly-full cache.

    ``buffer_origin`` -- the logical position of physical row 0 -- is
    *given*, not inferred, because ``seqlen_kv`` and ``cache_capacity``
    together do not determine it. It defaults to ``max(0, seqlen_kv -
    cache_capacity)``, which holds only when the buffer is **exactly full
    and holds precisely the most recent ``cache_capacity`` positions**,
    rolling one row per token -- HF's ``StaticSlidingWindowLayer``. An
    evictor working at block granularity (vLLM's block manager) frees whole
    blocks and so keeps *fewer* than ``cache_capacity`` live positions: its
    rows are still contiguous, time-ordered and oldest-first, yet row 0 sits
    later than the default computes. Every read would then land past the
    data, in bounds and unmasked, with nothing to detect it. Such a caller
    must pass its true ``buffer_origin``.
