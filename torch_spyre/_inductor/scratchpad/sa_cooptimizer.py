"""Joint work-division + LX-layout simulated-annealing engine.

``SaCoOptimizingSolver`` is a third co-optimization engine alongside the
substrate's CP-SAT and DFS solvers. It anneals the joint state ``(pi, W)``:

* ``pi`` -- the layout permutation, held in a *composed* (not subclassed)
  :class:`PermutationBasedLayoutSolver` packer, because this loop mixes move
  types and scores a richer objective than the packer's own ``quality()``.
* ``W`` -- the work division, one ``chosen_division`` menu index per buffer.

Moves are reorder, atomic division flip, and region-recolor; each structural
move runs as a compound move+burst judged as a unit by one Metropolis test.
Region-recolor floods the ``cd_parent_matches`` relation bidirectionally from a
non-trivial (split) anchor tiling, so the region *is* the flood's reach and
boundaries emerge for free; an edge with no compatible index becomes an accepted
internal seam.

Best-seen over ``(pi, W)`` from the seed state (every op at index 0, ``pi`` from
FirstFit) keeps every returned state no worse than that baseline.

Determinism: a seeded ``Random`` over index-ordered domains and the integer
fixed-point score make a run bit-for-bit reproducible.
