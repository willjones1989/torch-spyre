"""for_each_tile WhileLoop recognition, splicing, and direct loop-info stamping.

This module recognizes the exact WhileLoop shape torch-spyre#4136's
for_each_tile frontend (via decompose_scan_to_while_loop) produces, and owns
every step of turning one into tiled, schedulable ops:

1. Prove: try_prove_for_each_tile inspects a WhileLoop's cond_subgraph and
   decides whether it is for_each_tile-shaped, deriving a provable trip
   count. Every for_each_tile-specific assumption lives in this module;
   while_loop_bridge.py (the generic splice mechanism) knows none of them.

2. Splice: once accepted, splice_while_loops hands the WhileLoop to
   while_loop_bridge.splice_while_loop, which flattens the loop body into
   graph.operations in place. For a nested for_each_tile, splicing runs to a
   fixed point, outermost level first -- an inner WhileLoop only becomes
   visible once the outer splice has flattened its body in.

3. Identify the tile: each tile's real read/write is marked by a
   tile_dim_marker op (lowering.py's lower_tile_dim_marker).
   _consume_tile_dim_markers finds every marker's consuming op(s), inlines
   the marker's own per-iteration coordinate transform directly into each
   ComputedBuffer consumer (or, for a StarDep-shaped consumer with no
   inner_fn to inline into, redirects the reference and keeps the marker
   materialized), and erases the marker where possible. This produces the
   ground truth lookup_marker_dim later uses to say which read/write of an
   op is the tile and which of its own index variables is the tiled one.

4. Stamp: _stamp_direct_loop_info directly constructs and stamps a
   CoarseTileInfo on every op in a spliced group, one nesting level at a
   time, from ground truth already available at this point -- trip count
   (from the prover), loop var (from the spliced body), and tiled-dim
   position (from lookup_marker_dim, or a structural fallback anchored on
   the op's own output coordinates when no marker resolves it). This never
   calls coarse_tile_pre_stickify: re-deriving tiling from index
   coefficients independently at each nesting level risks a level's already-
   committed metadata going stale once a later-spliced, more-deeply-nested
   level renames or rewires the buffers that metadata depended on.
   splice_while_loops defers every stamp call to a single final phase, after
   every level of a nested for_each_tile has been spliced, so every op that
   will ever exist for this compile is present before any stamping happens
   -- see splice_while_loops's own docstring for why per-iteration stamping
   cannot work for a nested for_each_tile.

Real cond-graph shape (against a live compiled graph for both split_m_fn
(map mode) and split_k_fn (carry mode)): decompose_scan_to_while_loop always
lowers for_each_tile's cond_fn to a cond_subgraph.graph with exactly one
ir.Operation -- a scalar (size=[]) bool ComputedBuffer -- whose inner_fn
does exactly:

    tmp0 = ops.load(<cond graph's own first placeholder>, 0)
    tmp1 = ops.constant(N, torch.int64)
    tmp2 = tmp0 < tmp1
    return tmp2

i.e. `lt(iteration_sym, N)` with N a plain Python int/constant baked in by
the tracer (for_each_tile.py's `_step_counter`/`count_mode` logic always
carries the trip counter as carried_inputs[0], and the cond subgraph's own
first placeholder is that same carry positionally). `N` is not exposed as a
separate symbolic node anywhere reachable from the IR level -- it only shows
up as the literal second operand of the `<` -- so rather than parse
inner_fn's closure cells (an internal, unstable implementation detail of
torch._inductor.ir.make_pointwise/ops_wrapper), this module *runs* inner_fn
once under a small recording ops handler that intercepts `load`/`constant`
and returns opaque placeholders for everything else. This is the same "wrap
the ops handler, don't reconstruct index expressions" pattern CLAUDE.md
mandates for ComputedBuffer.inner_fn elsewhere in this codebase (see issue
#2797), applied here for read-only shape recognition rather than mutation.

    """Which carry positions are ``scan``-``ys`` stacking carries, not accumulators.

    ``for_each_tile``'s map mode has no user carry at all: ``scan`` requires
    one, so the frontend threads a step counter as the carry and puts the
    per-tile output in ``ys`` (see for_each_tile.py's ``map_mode`` branch and
    ``_stacked_to_full``). ``decompose_scan_to_while_loop`` then materializes
    that ``ys`` accumulation as ANOTHER ``carried_inputs`` entry, so at the
    ``ir.WhileLoop`` level it is positionally indistinguishable from a real
    accumulator carry -- yet it needs the opposite treatment (see
    while_loop_bridge.py's ``CarryBinding.stacking``).

    The distinguishing evidence, taken from the IR rather than from the
    frontend's own metadata (which does not survive to this point):

    1. The body does not compute a new value for this carry position -- its
       ``body_output`` IS the body's own placeholder for it, threaded
       through unchanged. A real accumulator's ``body_output`` is a
       different, op-produced buffer (``split_k_fn``: ``buf6``, its own
       ``acc + x @ y`` result).
    2. Some body op nonetheless WRITES it, in place, through a
       ``MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE`` whose target is a view of that
       placeholder -- so the carry is not merely a read-only pass-through
       leaf (``split_m_fn``'s X ``xs`` leaf is exactly that, and must NOT be
       folded).
    3. That write's per-iteration position depends on ``loop_var``: the
       target view's own offset mentions it. This is what makes it a stack
       of tiles rather than one whole-buffer overwrite, and it is the fact
       the fold arithmetic relies on. EXCEPT when ``trip_count == 1``: a
       single-trip loop's write offset has only one possible value, so
       Inductor's own symbolic simplification legitimately drops
       ``loop_var`` from it entirely, leaving offset=0 rather than an
       expression mentioning ``loop_var``. Treat that case as
       satisfying evidence 3 too, rather than falling through to the
       pass-through-leaf classification -- ``fold_stacked_carry_layout``
       already documents and handles this same trip_count=1 degeneracy on
       the fold-arithmetic side (its ``size[1] == 1`` branch), so detection
       must recognize the same shape or the fold never runs at all.

    Requiring all three keeps every other carry shape -- accumulator,
    read-only pass-through leaf, scalar step counter -- on the pre-existing
    path untouched.

    For each marker op (an op whose realized ComputedBuffer carries
    tile_marker_dim -- see lowering.py's lower_tile_dim_marker): find every
    consuming use among group_ops, record (op.get_name(), dep) -> dim in
    the returned map for each one, then erase the marker and remove the
    marker op from `operations`.

    A marker can have more than one consuming use: e.g. torch.softmax's
    default decomposition (amax, sub, exp, sum, div) reads its input tensor
    directly from two sibling ops (amax and sub both read the
    pre-decomposition value, per torch._inductor.decomposition's aten
    softmax decomp), so a for_each_tile tile whose body calls softmax on
    the whole tile produces a marker read by two independent ComputedBuffer
    consumers rather than one op chained through another. Each consuming
    read is resolved independently -- inlining the
    marker's transform into each ComputedBuffer consumer in turn, or
    redirecting each StarDep-shaped consumer's reference -- and the marker
    itself is erased only once every consuming read has been resolved (see
    below on why any StarDep consumer forces STAR_DEP_KEPT for the whole
    marker, even when other consumers were inlined).

    A marker's consumer can hold its read in either of two shapes (both
    already handled elsewhere in this package for the analogous WAR-hazard
    carry-snapshot redirect -- see while_loop_bridge.py's
    ``_snapshot_carry_placeholder``, whose ``hasattr(reader, "data")``
    branch is the same test used below):

    - A ``ComputedBuffer`` consumer (has ``.data``, an inner_fn-backed
      Pointwise/Reduction/Scan/Sort body): the read surfaces as a
      ``MemoryDep`` named after the marker in ``get_read_writes().reads``.
      Erased via ``_inline_marker_into_consumer``, which wraps (never
      reconstructs, per CLAUDE.md) the inner_fn with ``_InlineMarkerHandler``
      so every load of the marker re-issues the MARKER'S OWN inner_fn
      (``marker_op.data.make_loader()``) at the consumer's load-site index,
      rather than merely renaming past it. A plain name-swap
      (``pass_utils.redirect_computed_buffer_reads``/``NameSwapHandler``) is
      NOT used here: the marker's own body performs a genuine, non-identity
      per-iteration coordinate transform (the tile's slice offset -- e.g. an
      extra ``+ 24*u0`` advance term baked into the marker's own read index
      by ``lower_tile_dim_marker``), which a bare name-swap would silently
      drop, since ``NameSwapHandler.load`` passes the consumer's own index
      straight through unchanged. A plain rename produces silently wrong
      device-side numerics: every loop trip ends up reading the identical
      (tile-0-only) slice of the underlying tensor instead of advancing
      through it.
    - An ``InputsKernel``-family consumer (``ExternKernelOut``,
      ``FallbackKernel``, ``ConcatKernel``, ... -- no inner_fn, e.g. the CPU
      aten-fallback matmul for a for_each_tile tile read on a
      device-less/CPU fixture): the read surfaces as a ``StarDep`` (name
      only, no index/ranges) named after the marker, and is held as a
      direct Python object reference in the consumer's ``.inputs`` list (or
      ``.layout.target`` for a MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE write) rather than
      through any named load. Erased via
      ``while_loop_bridge._substitute_direct_input_refs``, which patches
      that reference in place to point at the marker's own input object
      instead -- the same helper (and the same object-identity-preserving
      unwrap-one-StorageBox-level care it documents) that
      ``_snapshot_carry_placeholder`` already relies on for this exact read
      shape.

    Zero consuming uses (of either shape) is an unrecognized shape and
    raises -- this pass runs on a freshly spliced body whose only consumers
    of a marker's output should be the op(s) for_each_tile's frontend wrote
    to read that tile, so no consumer at all means an assumption this
    module owns (see the module docstring) no longer holds and a silent
    guess would be worse than a loud failure. More than one StarDep-shaped
    consuming use also raises (see the dedicated check above) -- that shape
    (sibling for_each_tile loops sharing one outer tile, issue #4581) is not
    yet handled correctly, unlike multiple ComputedBuffer consuming uses.

    Must run before any hint synthesis -- callers of _hint_ranges_pos
    consult the module-level _MARKER_MAPS registry this function populates,
    and must see every marker already resolved and erased.

    Internally keyed by ``consumer_op.get_name()`` rather than
    ``consumer_op`` itself or ``id(consumer_op)``: ``ir.Operation``/
    ``ComputedBuffer`` are ``(unsafe_hash=False, eq=True)`` dataclasses, so
    Python sets their ``__hash__`` to ``None`` and they cannot be dict/set
    keys directly (see ``coarse_tile.py``'s ``plan: dict[int,
    CoarseTileInfo]`` docstring for the same, already-established
    convention in this codebase for using ``id()`` instead of the object).
    But ``id(op)`` itself is NOT safe here the way it is for that other
    convention's own single-pass, single-object lifetime: a *later*
    coarse-tiling sub-pass (e.g. ``_insert_all_read_copy_ops`` /
    ``_patch_consumer_to_read_copy``) can rebuild this exact consumer
    AGAIN via ``replace_computed_buffer_body`` -- for a completely
    unrelated read of the same op -- minting a new object with a new
    ``id()`` before ``lookup_marker_dim`` is ever called from
    ``_hint_ranges_pos`` -- silently orphaning an otherwise-still-matching
    map entry keyed by the old ``id()``, even when the rebuild was for a
    completely unrelated read of the same op. ``op.get_name()`` (the
    buffer name) is what stays
    stable across such a reconstruction -- every rebuild-via-
    ``replace_computed_buffer_body`` site in this package (this one
    included) preserves the original name, and other Spyre metadata
    (``PropagationPlan.outside_consumer_names``, etc.) already keys by name
    for exactly this reason -- see that field's own docstring on name
    stability. The returned map is keyed by ``(op.get_name(), dep)`` --
    ``lookup_marker_dim`` (the map's only reader) recomputes ``op.get_name()``
    itself, so callers never need the key's ``str`` half spelled out
    explicitly. For a StarDep-shaped consumer the dep stored is the StarDep
    itself (not a MemoryDep) --
    lookup_marker_dim's own read-walk already iterates every read
    regardless of type when matching by identity/equality against the map,
    and only special-cases MemoryDep for the (inapplicable to StarDep,
    which has no index) reduction-coordinate check.

    """Resolve loop_var's tiled-dim position for op via the marker map.

    Walks op's own reads and looks each one up in whichever _MARKER_MAPS
    entry was populated for the operations list this op belongs to, to
    confirm the read the marker map recorded for `op` is still present and
    to identify which of THAT read's own index variables carries loop_var's
    per-trip advance. Returns None if no mapped read resolves, signaling the
    caller (coarse_tile.py's _hint_ranges_pos) to raise rather than guess.

    The marker map's stored int (see _consume_tile_dim_markers) is NOT the
    position this function returns -- it is tile_dim_marker's own `dim`
    argument (for_each_tile.py's `spec.dim`), a position in the MARKER's
    OWN tensor shape (the tile operand's layout), unrelated to the
    consumer op's `data.ranges`/`data.reduction_ranges` numbering that every
    caller of _hint_ranges_pos requires (see its own docstring: "The
    position indexes op.data.ranges when the second element is False and
    op.data.reduction_ranges when it is True"). Passing the marker's raw
    dim straight through silently mis-selects the tiled position whenever
    the tile's own shape ordering differs from the consumer's -- e.g. a
    matmul reading a stacked tile leaf, where the marker's dim indexes the
    2-D tile [rows, cols] but the matmul's own output/reduction dims are
    numbered differently. A CPU aten-fallback matmul never surfaces this
    because it is a StarDep consumer (see below), which never reaches this
    position-mapping code at all -- so this class of bug is only visible
    on real Spyre-device codegen paths.

    So instead of trusting the map's stored int, re-derive the consumer's
    own position directly, scoped to exactly the one dep the marker map
    already identified as the tile read: find the read's own index
    variable `var` whose extent matches loop_var's per-trip advance
    (dep.index.coeff(loop_var) == dep.index.coeff(var) * dep.ranges[var]),
    then map `var` into op's own output coordinates
    (_loop_var_to_ranges_pos) or, if that misses and op is a Reduction,
    into op's own reduction vars (reduction_loop_vars.index).

    More than one var in dep.ranges can satisfy the same coefficient-
    coincidence equation on the SAME read -- e.g. a reduction dim whose
    extent numerically coincides with the tile size (flash-attention's
    online-softmax body, where D == SOFTMAX_TILE_SIZE). Because markers are
    authoritative and there is no fallback heuristic once a marker has
    identified the read, this ambiguity cannot be resolved by guessing:
    collect EVERY candidate var on the marker-identified dep (don't return
    on the first one found), and if more than one survives, raise rather
    than silently pick one. (This has not been observed to trigger against
    any fixture in this repo, including online-softmax's own D ==
    SOFTMAX_TILE_SIZE coincidence -- that coincidence lands on a read the
    marker map does NOT identify as the tile, so it never reaches this
    per-dep candidate collection at all -- but the check must still exist
    so a future shape that does collide on the marker's own dep fails
    loudly instead of guessing.)

    A mapped dep can be either a MemoryDep (ComputedBuffer/inner_fn-backed
    consumer) or a StarDep (InputsKernel-family consumer, e.g.
    ExternKernelOut -- see _consume_tile_dim_markers). StarDep has no
    .index/.ranges (.index raises NotImplementedError) and no coordinate
    space to resolve a position in at all -- but this is moot, not a gap:
    plan_coarse_tile_groups (coarse_tile.py, this function's only real
    caller path) already skips every non-ComputedBuffer op before ever
    calling _hint_ranges_pos, and every StarDep-shaped consumer
    (ExternKernelOut and the rest of the InputsKernel family) has no
    `.data`/inner_fn and so is never a ComputedBuffer. A StarDep-mapped
    entry therefore never needs a resolved position in practice; return
    None for it rather than guess.

    Scoped to ONLY the marker map belonging to the CURRENT compile's own
    ``V.graph.operations`` list -- never every entry in the module-level
    ``_MARKER_MAPS`` registry (see ``_MARKER_MAPS``'s own docstring for why
    searching every entry in the registry would be unsafe). ``V.graph`` is
    the live ``GraphLowering`` for whichever compile is currently running
    this pass pipeline, so ``V.graph.operations`` is guaranteed to be the
    SAME list object ``_consume_tile_dim_markers`` was given for this exact

    """Directly construct and stamp one CoarseTileInfo level per op.

    Ground truth only -- trip count from try_prove_for_each_tile, loop_var
    from _body_loop_var, per-op tiled-dim resolution from
    lookup_marker_dim. Never calls coarse_tile_pre_stickify: the program
    already states trip count, loop var, tile dim, and carry roles as
    ground truth, so re-deriving them via double-blind per-level
    coarse_tile_pre_stickify inference is unnecessary and unsafe -- one
    level's committed metadata (e.g. tiled_dims_per_read computed against a
    provisional buffer name) can go stale once a later-spliced nested level
    renames or rewires the buffers it depended on. propagation is never
    produced -- every CoarseTileInfo built here leaves it None -- because
    PropagationPlan has zero consumers outside coarse_tile.py's own Pass
    1/2/3, which while_loop groups skip entirely.

    Called once per while_loop nesting level, in group_idx-ascending
    (outermost-first) order -- see splice_while_loops's own docstring for
    why stamping is deferred to a single final phase in this order. Each
    call extends whatever single CoarseTileInfo a strictly-outer level's
    own call already stamped, never overwriting it. ``op.loop_info`` is
    ALWAYS a single ``CoarseTileInfo`` (never a list of them) -- consistent
    with every other stamping site in the codebase (coarse_tile.py's own
    ``op.loop_info = dataclasses.replace(info, ...)``, padding.py,
    read_copy_elision.py, insert_restickify.py, and
    work_division_constraints.py's own reader, which does
    ``for level_dims in loop_info.loop_tiled_dims`` directly against
    ``ctx.op.loop_info`` with no list-of-CoarseTileInfo indirection
    anywhere). ``CoarseTileInfo``'s own per-level list fields
    (loop_group_id/loop_count/loop_tiled_dims/loop_tiled_reduction_dims/
    tiled_dims_per_read's and output_tiled_dims's per-level entries) already
    encode every nesting level inside ONE object, outermost first (per
    loop_info.py's docstring). See the `existing is not None` branch below
    for the append-not-prepend convention this relies on when a later,
    strictly-inner call extends an already-stamped op.

    tiled_dims_per_read/output_tiled_dims are filled from
    ``op.get_read_writes()`` ground truth: a dep advances at this level iff
    its own index has a nonzero coefficient on loop_var, in which case its
    extent for this (single) level is simply trip_count -- no multi-level
    extent composition is needed here, since each call only ever computes
    one new level's contribution before appending it onto any existing
    per-read entries. ``op.get_read_writes()`` returns reads in the same
    order regardless of which level's call invokes it (it is a pure
    function of the op's own current IR, not of loop_info), so appending
    this level's per-read entry at the same read-index an outer call already
    populated is positionally safe.

    squeezed_advance_per_read/squeezed_advance_output cover a dep whose
    index carries a nonzero coefficient on loop_var that neither
    _extent_at_pos nor _structural_resolve could attribute to one of this
    op's own tiled dims (e.g. a point-shaped or already-resolved-elsewhere
    read/write) -- mirroring coarse_tile.py's own
    _point_splice_advance_for_dep, which records the identical
    (coefficient, 1) shape for its own splice-only advances. This is
    stamped explicitly here, at ground-truth time, specifically so
    SpyreKernel._general_tile_advance never needs to re-derive whether a
    splice symbol merely appearing in dep.index implies a real per-trip
    advance -- it does not in general (a restickified V-tile pool read is
    genuinely pinned across trips despite loop_var being a free symbol of
    its dep.index by construction). A dep whose coefficient on
    loop_var is exactly zero gets no entry at all here, which is itself the
    explicit "pinned, do not advance" verdict -- not a gap for
    _general_tile_advance to fill in.

    Also appends a minimal ``DimHint(loop_var=loop_var,
    loop_var_range=trip_count)`` onto ``op.dim_hints``. This is NOT a
    revival of ``_synthesize_dim_hints_for_group`` (no hint_id minting, no
    is_reduction/dim_names/split_count advisory content -- those fields are
    left at their dataclass defaults and unread by any consumer on this
    path). It exists only to keep ``loop_var_ranges_from_dim_hints`` (see
    pass_utils.py) working: that helper -- and its callers
    ``op_out_coords`` and ``_build_indirect_store_subs`` -- reads
    ``{h.loop_var: h.loop_var_range for h in op.dim_hints}`` to recognize a
    WhileLoop-splice loop_var that is deliberately not a ``dep.ranges`` key.
    Without this, ``_build_indirect_store_subs`` misclassifies loop_var as
    a runtime scatter-row symbol (its only signal is "not a loop range
    key"), which crashed as "indirect symbol not found in indirect_sizes
    {}" once this function stopped populating dim_hints. See
    _build_indirect_store_subs's own docstring for the identical bug this
    once already fixed for the old mechanism.

        Only attempted when dep.index actually carries loop_var (per-dep,
        not per-op, since reads and the write can each independently need
        it). Uses op's own output coordinates (ground truth for the op's
        own tiled-dim positions) to find loop_var's ranges position, then
        derives this dep's own per-trip extent from its own coefficient on
        loop_var divided by the mapped symbol's coefficient in this SAME
        dep's index -- reusing trip_count here would be wrong whenever this
        dep's own per-trip step differs from loop_var's per-trip step.

        op_out_coords can raise Unsupported for >=3 levels of nesting, when
        an outer level's own loop_var is not yet covered by this op's
        dim_hints -- caught here and treated identically to "no structural
        match", i.e. no stamp for this dep, not a crash. This is strictly
        more permissive than the no-fallback behavior (every dep hit the
        no-stamp outcome before this fallback existed), so it cannot
        regress a case that worked before.

        `prior_levels` is this SAME dep's own already-stamped (pos, extent)
        entries, flattened across every strictly-inner level a prior call
        already stamped (``existing.tiled_dims_per_read[i]`` /

        a stamped level at that same position from a strictly-inner call --
        that is a genuine collision: two independent levels both claiming
        the same device dim, each minting its own advance symbol in
        _general_tile_advance, so the dim would advance twice per trip
        instead of once. Rejecting merely because `loop_var` shares free
        symbols with another coordinate is NOT safe: a WhileLoop-splice-
        folded write index (e.g. coordinate ``d0 + 2*u5``, where ``d0`` is
        this op's own local tile coordinate) can legitimately have that
        shape with no real collision at all -- rejecting unconditionally
        there leaves output_tiled_dims empty and breaks codegen addressing.
        So the check is scoped precisely to "this dep already has a stamped

        producing a wrong device advance for a real, multi-element tiled

        `pos` alone -- `pos` is a position in the relevant namespace, and
        more than one dep.ranges var can share it only when they're
        genuinely the same tiled dim, so re-matching here is safe and

def _recordable_op_names(group_ops: list["ir.Operation"]) -> list[str]:
    """Names group_ops will resolve to by the time every level is spliced.

    A nested (not-yet-accepted-this-iteration) for_each_tile's own
    ir.WhileLoop can still be sitting inside group_ops here, unspliced --
    it only becomes visible to try_prove_for_each_tile on a LATER iteration
    of splice_while_loops's `while True:` driver, once ITS nesting level
    gets accepted and spliced in turn. Recording group_ops's own names
    verbatim would therefore include this WhileLoop's name and its
    MultiOutput children's names -- neither of which survive that later
    splice_while_loop call, which replaces the WhileLoop wholesale with its
    body_subgraph's own ops (under entirely different names) and drops the
    WhileLoop's MultiOutput children from graph.operations outright (see
    splice_while_loop's own docstring and its trailing graph.operations
    filter). A name recorded for either would never resolve at stamp time.

    But every op that a later splice of this nested WhileLoop will
    eventually materialize -- including an accumulator-add op that does not
    exist as a distinct object yet -- already has a fixed, predictable name:
    while_op.body_subgraph.graph.operations is the body subgraph's own op
    list, already carrying its final (fully-prefixed) names before its own
    splice ever runs -- e.g. a doubly-nested body's ops already read as
    "..._while_loop_body_graph_0_0_while_loop_body_graph_0_bufN" even before
    the inner WhileLoop's own splice_while_loop call. So this level's
    op_names must recurse into any nested ir.WhileLoop's own
    body_subgraph.graph.operations (arbitrarily deep, for >2 nesting
    levels) and record ITS names instead of the WhileLoop's own -- that is
    what gives an op materialized only by a later, inner splice a chance to
    receive this (outer) level's own stamped contribution too, which is the
    entire point of deferring stamping in the first place. The WhileLoop's
    own MultiOutput children (which never survive its splice either way)
    are dropped with no replacement.

    One more staleness gap this recursion must account for: a nested,
    not-yet-spliced body's own operations snapshot (taken here, before that
    body's OWN splice_while_loop/`_consume_tile_dim_markers` calls ever run)
    still includes its own tile_dim_marker op(s) -- see `_marker_dim`. Most
    of those are erased outright (not rebuilt under the same name, unlike a
    marker's *consumer*, which _consume_tile_dim_markers rebuilds via
    replace_computed_buffer_body and which therefore DOES keep a stable,
    recordable name -- see splice_while_loops's own docstring) once that
    nested level's own `_consume_tile_dim_markers` call actually runs, on a
    LATER iteration of the `while True:` driver. A marker's name recorded
    here would therefore usually never resolve at stamp time, so markers are
    excluded from the RECURSED (still-nested, not-yet-consumed) branch the
    same way the WhileLoop's own MultiOutput children are.

    This exclusion must NOT apply to the top-level `group_ops` this function
    is originally called with (as opposed to a nested body's operations,
    reached only via the recursive call above): `splice_while_loops` always
    calls `_consume_tile_dim_markers(group_ops, graph.operations)` for
    THIS level's own group_ops before calling this function, so by the time
    this function sees them, every one of this level's own markers has
    already been resolved one of two ways (see MarkerResolution): a
    ComputedBuffer-consumer marker is INLINE_ERASED and no longer present in
    group_ops at all (nothing to exclude), but a StarDep-consumer marker
    (e.g. one whose sole consumer is a still-nested inner WhileLoop's
    carried input -- exactly the outer-M/inner-K shape this module exists
    for) is deliberately kept materialized (STAR_DEP_KEPT) as a real,
    addressable buffer that group_ops still legitimately contains and that
    DOES need this level's own stamp -- excluding it here silently drops it
    from `pending_levels`, leaving its `dim_hints`/`loop_info` unstamped and
    producing a codegen-time "indirect symbol ... not found in
    indirect_sizes" failure. So the marker check below only fires while
    recursing into a still-nested WhileLoop's own body (`nested`), never at
    this function's own top-level `group_ops`.

def splice_while_loops(graph) -> None:
    """CustomPreSchedulingPasses entry point: splice every for_each_tile WhileLoop.

    Runs to a fixed point (handles nested for_each_tile, whose inner
    WhileLoop only appears after the outer one's body has been spliced in).
    Directly constructs and stamps CoarseTileInfo per accepted group from
    ground truth (trip count, loop var, tile_dim_marker resolution, carry
    roles) via _stamp_direct_loop_info -- never hands the group to
    coarse_tile_pre_stickify for re-inference, since coarse_tile_pre_stickify's
    index-coefficient inference runs once per nesting level, blind to prior
    runs, and a level's committed metadata can go stale once a later-spliced
    nested level renames or rewires the buffers it depended on (see
    _stamp_direct_loop_info's own docstring for the full rationale).

    Splicing itself runs outermost-first for a nested for_each_tile: the
    outer WhileLoop is visible in graph.operations immediately, while an
    inner WhileLoop only becomes visible once the outer splice flattens its
    body in on a later iteration of the `while True:` loop below. But ALL
    stamping is deferred to a single final phase, run only after every level
    has been spliced -- i.e. after this function's own `while True:` driver
    has exited. This is necessary, not merely convenient: an op materialized
    only by an INNER level's splice (e.g. an accumulator-add whose write
    buffer is a fresh per-outer-trip allocation) does not exist yet at the
    time an outer level's splice iteration finishes, so stamping outer-first
    per-iteration (the old structure) would call _stamp_direct_loop_info for
    the outer level before that op exists -- it can never receive the outer
    level's tiling contribution, silently corrupting its device-address
    advance. Deferring every _stamp_direct_loop_info call to after the last
    splice guarantees every op that will ever exist for this compile is
    already present before any stamping happens.

    Per-level ops are recorded by NAME (`op.get_name()`, via
    `_recordable_op_names`), never by object reference:
    `_consume_tile_dim_markers`, invoked here on a LATER splice iteration
    for a different, still-nested level, can replace a ComputedBuffer
    object in `graph.operations` via `pass_utils.replace_computed_buffer_body`
    (see `_inline_marker_into_consumer` above), which mints a brand-new
    object at the same list index under the SAME name. An object reference
    collected on an earlier splice iteration would silently go stale by the
    time the stamp phase runs; the name stays stable across such a rebuild
    (the same convention `_consume_tile_dim_markers`'s own docstring
    documents for its marker map). `_recordable_op_names` additionally
    recurses into any still-nested (not yet accepted this iteration)
    ir.WhileLoop found in group_ops, recording its body_subgraph's own
    (already fixed, pre-splice) op names instead of the WhileLoop's own --
    otherwise an op materialized only once THAT WhileLoop is itself spliced
    on a later iteration (e.g. the accumulator-add) would never be recorded
    for this (outer) level at all, since it does not exist as a distinct
    object yet. See `_recordable_op_names`'s own docstring for why those
    names are already fixed and predictable ahead of that later splice.

    Some operations have no predictable pre-splice name: a nested level's
    splice can create carry snapshots, and a marker excluded from an
    ancestor's prospective names can survive as STAR_DEP_KEPT. Each nested
    WhileLoop therefore carries the indices of its accepted ancestors. When
    that loop is later spliced, its final recordable names are appended to
    every ancestor's pending name list. This makes those late-created ops
    members of the complete loop nest instead of a sibling group containing
    only their immediate level.

    Stamping itself still proceeds level-0-first (outermost first) within
    the single final phase: level 0's call stamps first (existing=None,
    loop_group_id=(0,)), and a strictly-inner level's later call resolves
    the SAME live object again by name and APPENDS -- e.g. level 1 onto
    level 0 yields loop_group_id=(0, 1). See the `existing is not None`
    branch inside _stamp_direct_loop_info for why append, not prepend, is
    required here.
