    Move a slice mutation onto an alternate layout when the original layout
    cannot express the required stick offset.

    In that case, propagate_layouts picks an alternate layout and stores
    op._restickify_plan = (target_name, orig_stl, alt_stl). What this pass then
    does depends on the target kind:

    An **internal buffer** is compiler-allocated, so it is already allocated in
    alt_stl and has no caller address or prior data to preserve. Nothing is
    inserted; the write is only rebound onto the alt-layout buffer. See
    _retarget_internal_buf_mutation.

    A **graph input** must keep its address and surrounding data, so it needs the
    full sequence below. Because the restickify op cannot write its output in
    place, the mutation writes into a temporary buffer buf_tmp in alt_stl layout.
    This pass inserts:

      1. restickify op: arg0_1 (orig_stl) -> buf_tmp        (alt_stl)
      2. mutation op:   buf               -> buf_tmp[slice] (alt_stl)
      3. copy-back op:  buf_tmp (alt_stl) -> arg0_1         (alt_stl)
      4. set_spyre_tensor_layout(arg0_1, alt_stl)

    Both (1) and (3) are inserted as restickify IR nodes via
    _create_restickify_node. In (3), the input and output STLs are both alt_stl,
    so in the later codegen pass it reduces to an identity copy. Its layout is set
    to MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE(arg0_1), which makes the scheduler write the
    result back to arg0_1's original memory address.

    Both the mutation op and the copy-back use MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE to
    declare their write targets and reuse Inductor's existing mutation handling.

    The restickify op also records an input-layout override on
    buf_tmp._input_layout_overrides so work division and codegen both read
    arg0_1 using orig_stl for that op.

    arg0_1 is returned unchanged so DCI still reads from the same memory address.
