"""OpSpec -> KTIR emitter.

``generate_ktir`` is an OpSpec consumer: it consumes the finished
``list[OpSpec | LoopSpec]`` kernel contract (the same contract the SDSC bundle
emitter ``generate_bundle`` consumes) and emits **KTDP-dialect MLIR** directly.
The module is built with the ``mlir_ktdp`` Python builders, so the returned
``str(module)`` is canonical, verifier-checked MLIR that the golden snapshot
test consumes without drift.

It uses the OpSpec-reading helpers from ``opspec_utils`` to adapt the OpSpec
information to generate_ktir.

Base addresses are emitted either as func arguments or as baked
``arith.constant``s, selected by the ``bake_addresses`` option.  The baked
form is a temporary dataflow-scheduler#65 workaround, to be reverted when the
backend accepts symbolic addresses.

Structure
---------

``generate_ktir`` is three steps, in this order:

1. ``build_kernel_plan(specs)`` -- a **pure** recursive walk of the spec tree
   that runs every derivation, raises every ``NotImplementedError`` the emitter
   can raise, and returns a ``KernelPlan``: the grid, the buffers, and a tree of
   ``Step`` records for the body.  It imports nothing from ``mlir_ktdp``, so
   every rejection is reachable and testable where the dialect build is absent.
2. ``KtirBuilder.create(plan)`` -- the single ``mlir_ktdp`` import site; owns
   the context and the per-module state.
3. ``b.emit(plan.steps)`` -- a recursive walk of the step tree.  It reads no
   spec and derives nothing, so emission cannot refuse a request the plan
   accepted.

Adding an op is one ``RECIPES`` entry; giving an op it already has a second
spelling at some element format is one ``Arm`` inside that entry; adding an
emission *shape* is one method on ``KtirBuilder`` plus one ``Surface`` arm in
``compute``.

    *spellings* (``f16``, ``i32``), so the record stays dialect-free; the
    builder's ``named_type`` is what resolves a spelling against the imported

    ``ir.AffineMap`` and iterator attributes, so the record stays dialect-free

    map, the way ``access_tile`` already turns a rank into an identity.

    No ``extents`` field: ``linalg.generic`` infers its loop bounds from the
    operand shapes and the maps, so nothing would read one.

    ``None`` in a row is the CONSTANT 0 result position: an axis the operand does
    not walk, read at its first element for every iteration.  It is what the three
    broadcast forms are made of -- ``(d0,d1,d2) -> (d1, 0)`` reads a statistic at
    the head of its stick, ``(d0,d1) -> (d0, 0)`` splats it back across one, and
    ``(d0,d1,d2) -> (d0, 0, d2)`` reads one row of a weight for every row of the
    output.  Zero and not an arbitrary constant, because a tile is placed by its
    access indices and an operand axis that walks nothing is read at the tile's own
    origin; a non-zero offset would be an addressing decision, and addressing is
    ``Access.index_coeffs``' business.

    A row is otherwise a bare dim index per position, which is every map in scope
    and not every map there is: a *linearised* map such as
    ``(d0, d1, d2, d3, d4) -> (d0, d2 * 64 + d3, d4)`` needs (coefficient, dim)

# PlanFusion: OpSpec sequences the device computes as one op, fused at PLAN time
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A SPECIALIZED FUSER FOR KTIR OPS.  Not general-purpose, and it must not grow
# into one: everything below is licensed by the fact that this module knows what
# it is about to emit and what the consequences of that emission are.  An
# upstream pass has no such licence, which is why this is not upstream.
#
# A fusion is not a legality decision.  The torch-spyre machinery already made
# that one, by handing this emitter a kernel holding both ops; the table only
# says WHICH sequences the device computes as one instruction, and declines on
# anything it does not recognise rather than guessing.  So every fusion here is
# OPPORTUNISTIC -- a strict subset of the scheduler's own fusion decisions,
# converting a chosen fusion into a better kernel and never creating one.
#
# A SPAN is the run of CONSECUTIVE OpSpecs a pattern matched -- ``specs[i:i+n]``
# for a pattern of n slots -- and it is the unit everything here works on: what a
# pattern matches and what a rewrite consumes.  For the one entry shipped, a span
# is two specs, an ``abs`` and the ``max`` that reads it.
#
# AN ENTRY IS A PATTERN AND A RESULT NAME.  The pattern is positional op names
# and reduction flags, a prefilter deciding which spans are considered at all;
# the result name is what the collapsed span is called.  The rewrite is SHARED
# (``_collapse_producer``) because nothing in it is specific to one entry: every
# condition it checks is a fact about deleting a producer and reading its source
# in its place.  There is exactly ONE rewrite, so no field names it; a field
# selecting the rewrite earns its place when there is a second thing to select.
#
# THERE IS NO KTIR COST MODEL.  Without a cost function over emitted kernels
# there is no basis on which to justify a MANDATORY fusion, so opportunistic is
# the most that can be defended.
