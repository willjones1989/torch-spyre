"""OpSpec-reading helpers.

The KTIR emitter consumes the *finished* ``OpSpec`` list and must agree on the
"decision / arithmetic" it implies: buffer identity, row-major strides,
iteration-space grouping, and reshape / broadcast alignment of pointwise
operands.  Those computations are **pure** (sympy / int over the ``op_specs``)
-- no backend emission primitives, no MLIR builder, no live Inductor kernel
state -- so they live here as plain functions rather than as base-class methods.

They are therefore **emitter-agnostic**: they read the ``OpSpec`` contract
without emitting any target IR, so one set can serve every OpSpec consumer.  The
KTIR emitter is simply the first such consumer (hence the KTIR references
below); future emitters are intended to share them, which is why the module is
named for the ``OpSpec`` it reads rather than for KTIR.

``__all__`` is the contract: those names are what a consumer may import.  Anything
underscore-prefixed is a step inside one of them -- reachable from a test, but not
something to build on.

    ``None`` is an axis the operand does not walk at all: its coordinate carries
    no iteration symbol and its extent is one element, so every iteration reads
    that one element and the map's result position is the CONSTANT 0.  That is the
